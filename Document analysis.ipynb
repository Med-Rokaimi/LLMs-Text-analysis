Programme rationale\\n          1. Since its return to democracy in 1989, Paraguay has made efforts to strengthen its political institutions\\n          and public administration. On average, the annual growth rate of its gross domestic product (GDP) from\\n          1982 to 2002 was only 2 per cent; GDP per capita remained stagnant. Between 2003 and 2013, however,\\n          the average annual growth rate reached approximately 5 per cent. Nevertheless, the average annual growth\\n          rate hides strong volatility resulting from weather related shocks. In 2013, the growth rate was 13.6 per\\n          cent (the highest in Latin America) showing sharp recovery after contracting by 1.2 per cent in 2012 as a\\n          result of a severe drought, according to International Monetary Fund figures for 2014. In 2012, the\\n          country's GDP per capita was $4,497 (measured in 2005 United States dollars purchasing power parity\\n          terms). Despite recent economic recovery and a favourable growth outlook, the country’s key challenges\\n          include reducing poverty and inequality through an inclusive, sustainable pattern of growth, reducing\\n          vulnerability to macroeconomic changes in neighbouring countries (especially Brazil), enhancing\\n          democratic institutions, fostering accountability and responsiveness to citizen’s demand for voice and\\n          participation, and enhancing individuals and community resilience in the face of natural and anthropogenic\\n          risks.\\n          2. The total poverty rate in Paraguay was 23.8 per cent in 2013. The country has seen a reduction in\\n          poverty based on income of about 20 percentage points since 2003 (44 per cent). With extreme poverty\\n          rates reaching 10.1 per cent in 2013, the country is close to achieving the Millennium Development Goal\\n          (MDG) target of 9 per cent reduction. In 2003, the rate of extreme poverty was 21.2 per cent. The country’s\\n          poor are concentrated in rural areas (57.4 per cent of the total) and poverty impacts 32.5 per cent of\\n          women, according to 2011 data. While indigenous peoples account for only 2 per cent of the country's\\n          population, 71.8 per cent of them live in poverty (2008), 39 per cent are illiterate and their participation in\\n          the labour market is low at 52 per cent. Agriculture and livestock accounted for about 23 per cent of GDP\\n          in 2013, but their indirect contribution is as high as 41 per cent, which makes it a main driver of economic\\n          growth. Paraguay's labour force participation rate is 64.3 per cent, higher for men than for women (74.7\\n          per cent and 53.8 per cent, respectively.) The working population constitutes 95.1 per cent of the labour\\n          force participation rate and underemployment is 20.6 per cent. In 2013, the Gini index was 0.4776, lower\\n          than in 2011 (0.5199). However, owing to historical causes, the land concentration index (Gini) is one of\\n          the highest in Latin America at 0.93 (2008). In 2012, with a human development index of 0.659, Paraguay\\n          ranked 111 out of 186 countries, according to the Human Development Report 2013, lower than the Latin\\n          American average of 0.741. In general, the country is showing good progress on the MDGs, with\\n          challenges in basic sanitation, child mortality and maternal mortality.\\n          3. Much current growth and poverty reduction are linked to a primary natural resource boom. In the\\n          primary sector, the production of livestock and commercial agriculture has increased in recent decades and\\n          the planted soy area almost tripled between 1997 and 2012. This situation threatens forest cover and\\n          increases emissions resulting from land use changes, which accounts for 95 per cent of the country’s total\\n          CO2 emissions. The forest loss rate has doubled the Latin America average, totalling approximately\\n          179,000 hectares per year, with the resulting destruction of livelihoods, mainly that of indigenous peoples.\\n          This situation will likely cause an increase in the frequency of severe droughts and floods and their related\\n          social and economic costs: lack of water for residential and production usage, significant impact on the\\n          primary sector, and heightened difficulties in accessing energy. In fact, although Paraguay is the country\\n          with the highest global per capita hydroelectricity generation rate, its consumption in the energy matrix is\\n          only about 15 per cent. Currently, 46 per cent of the country's energy consumption consists of biomass. The\\n          industrial sector is highly wood-dependant, representing 49.6 per cent of energy consumption. One of the\\n          greatest challenges is to reconcile economic growth opportunities with natural resource usage that fosters\\n          the inclusion of vulnerable populations (women and indigenous populations) into a more sustainable and\\n          equitable development process.\\n2/15                                                                                                              14-57594\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                              DP/DCP/PRY/2\\n         4. The weakness of democratic institutions, coupled with limited civic participation, is a major challenge for\\n         inclusive, participatory democratic governance. Comparative indicators show poor political stability (the\\n         World Bank indicator was -0.84 in 2012) and low government efficiency (-0.90 in 2014). In addition,\\n         according to Latino Barometer 2013, 58 per cent of Paraguayans consider that their “democracy has huge\\n         problems”. This “low-quality democracy” is partly the result of weak empowerment of poor and excluded\\n         populations, including indigenous people, who lack the mechanisms that would give them greater voice on\\n         policymaking. Furthermore, even though the rate of merit-based public appointments increased from 1 to 26\\n         per cent between 2008 and 2011), it remains low and limits the efficiency of public administration. Other\\n         factors that severely restrict the progressive realization of civil and political rights are: (a) limited access to\\n         justice, particularly for the poor living in rural areas and for indigenous people as a result of the geographic\\n         centralization of justice mechanisms; (b) social bias in access to justice (only 18 per cent of the population\\n         considers that there is equality under the law) and to public services; (c) insufficient corruption control (in\\n         2013 Paraguay ranked 150 out of 177 countries, according to the corruption perceptions index of\\n         Transparency International); and (d) accountability deficit (the World Bank value for voice and accountability\\n         was minus 0.15 in 2012). In sum, there is a need to enhance citizen’s voice and participation and to modernize\\n         and strengthen government institutions, in particular the electoral system, in order to enhance people’s voice\\n         through political representation. In particular, women's presence in political decision-making is limited, with\\n         only 19 per cent of seats in parliament. Overall, this situation translates into persistent citizen detachment\\n         from political institutions. In fact, satisfaction with democracy fell from 39 to 25 per cent between 2011 and\\n         2013, according to Latino Barometer.\\n         5. Vulnerability to natural disasters continues to threaten economic and social achievements achieved to\\n         date. The country's risk map is highly diverse, with recurrent and cyclic flood and drought events impacting\\n         both urban and rural areas. Social and human-induced threats linked to the dynamics of economic growth,\\n         poverty, income inequality and concentrated land holding compound the effects of extreme weather events\\n         which directly affect livelihoods, especially that of poor rural populations and indigenous people.\\n         Urbanization has grown progressively and the lack of employment has fostered rural-urban migration. New\\n         settlers are concentrated in risk areas around large urban centres, increasing their vulnerability. Paraguay is\\n         mainly an urban country, with 59.2 per cent of its people living in cities versus 40.8 per cent in rural areas.\\n         Institutional frameworks designed to support the implementation of public policies and enable greater\\n         resilience have shown major progress at the national level. The national risk management and reduction policy\\n         approved in 2014 is a relevant step in this direction. Still, some challenges remain in consolidating an\\n         integrated national risk management and resilience promotion system and in building the country's capacity to\\n         assess and quantify the impact of disasters and other threats. While Paraguay has made efforts and progress at\\n         the national level, regulatory frameworks and institutions for the implementation of risk management policies\\n         at the local level are just emerging and need to incorporate a gender and indigenous people-sensitive\\n         approach. Likewise, the country lacks unified tools and consolidated maps at the national and subnational\\n         levels that would help to assess risks properly and foster systems to calculate economic losses resulting from\\n         disasters. With regard to disaster preparedness and response, the Government faces the challenge of\\n         developing a national early warning system and nationwide plans to address threats in a coordinated manner.\\n         6. The assessment of development results 2010 highlighted the UNDP contribution in the context of the\\n         democratic transition of the last 10 years. The assessment showed that UNDP worked in crucial areas to lay\\n         the foundations for human development; enriched the debate and thinking through its technical assistance and\\n         advisory services in a critical period of changes; and strengthened the capacities of the Executive Branch.\\n         Evaluations from 2010 and 2012 showed that UNDP had positively impacted policymaking, resulting in the\\n         first ever structured body of social policies, the creation of environmental policies, risk management policies\\n         with local accountability, and the positioning in the public agenda of the eradication of discriminatory\\n         practices based on gender and ethnicity. UNDP also contributed to developing democratic social\\n         organizations, acted as a mediator helping parties to reach agreements based on the equilibrium between\\n         social demand and the capacity of the state to meet them, and facilitated consensus building. UNDP supported\\n         the modernization and increased efficiency of public entities, which deeply impacted the creation of the Social\\n14-57594                                                                                                                3/15\\n\\n\\nDP/DCP/PRY/2\\n          Cabinet and its technical secretariat and the development of capacities in different ministries and national\\n          institutions.\\n          7. Lessons learned from the previous cooperation cycles suggest that the value added of UNDP in Paraguay\\n          consists in its helping to develop capacity through high quality technical assistance and advisory services that\\n          support public policy design and implementation and the application of results-based management systems.\\n          The comparative advantage of UNDP in this field is based on its own experiences, its best practices in\\n          verifiable, replicable and scalable interventions at the local or national levels, and a broad regional and global\\n          knowledge network. Key development partners have consistently drawn attention to the capacity of UNDP to\\n          facilitate the coordination of public, private and international cooperation and to foster dialogue and build\\n          consensus in the support of public policies as one of its comparative advantages. The new programme is hence\\n          consistent with the organization’s strategic institutional change and focuses on providing high-quality policy\\n          advice and programming approaches aimed at responding to development challenges.\\n          8. In order to guarantee the sustainability of UNDP interventions, the assessment of development results\\n          recommended more direct support to civil society, stronger links with parliament and the judiciary, and greater\\n          focus on the most vulnerable populations. It also emphasized the need to strengthen institutional capacities to\\n          achieve results and address the challenges of UNDP programme sustainability. In light of these\\n          recommendations, UNDP will promote cooperation at the national and subnational levels, which will involve\\n          the executive branch – as public policy developer; parliament – in its supervisory and law-making roles; the\\n          judiciary – to guarantee access to justice; citizens’ organizations – in their dual role as active agents and policy\\n          guardians; entrepreneurs – as leaders of shared value investments and decent work; and academia and\\n          non-governmental organizations (NGOs) – as leveraging agents of transformational thinking and action.\\n     II. Programme priorities and partnerships\\n          9. The country programme, 2015-2019, contributes to the national development plan, 2013-2018,\\n          and is aligned with the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) , 2015-2019,\\n          and the UNDP strategic plan, 2014-2017.\\n          10. Growth and development are inclusive and sustainable, incorporating productive capacities that\\n          create employment and livelihoods for the poor and excluded. UNDP will focus on supporting the\\n          extreme poverty reduction efforts of the Government, and the improvement of social protection\\n          systems, through pilot experiences that will feed into public policy design and eventually be scaled up\\n          at the national level. Using national human development reports, UNDP will foster efforts to give\\n          greater voice to citizens and promote their participation in public life through, for example, forums for\\n          discussion, and it will recommend development solutions that speak to the concerns of citizens and\\n          decision makers. Building on past experiences, UNDP will support the participatory design of\\n          environmentally sustainable and socially responsible production models. These models, which the\\n          former programme cycle did not address, will target commercial and household agriculture and will\\n          be based on partnerships among public institutions, the private sector, academi a and civil society\\n          (particularly farmer, indigenous and environmental organizations) and will have a strong gender\\n          perspective. UNDP will support gender-sensitive climate change mitigation and adaptation policies,\\n          strategies and action plans through South-South cooperation at the regional and global levels. UNDP\\n          will promote energy access and efficiency, with a focus on vulnerable populations. UNDP will\\n          coordinate efforts with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equity and Women’s Empowerment\\n          (UN-Women), the World Food Programme (WFP), UNFPA and the United Nations Children’s Fund\\n          (UNICEF), particularly for the achievement of MDGs 1 and 7 to reduce extreme poverty and poverty;\\n          cut back greenhouse gases and deforestation; expand protected areas; and increase the population with\\n          access to potable water and sanitation facilities.\\n4/15                                                                                                                   14-57594\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                      DP/DCP/PRY/2\\n         11. Strengthened democratic governance to meet citizen expectations. The country programme will\\n         aim to support universal access to justice by strengthening its functioning at the central and\\n         subnational levels. It will also support efforts to improve civil service professionalism at the central\\n         level, striving for better, more responsive and transparent service delivery. In order to promote\\n         anti-corruption strategies, UNDP will strengthen the anti-corruption units of line ministries and the\\n         National Anti-Corruption Secretariat. The organization will support efforts to strengthen the\\n         management capacities and institutional frameworks of the judiciary, the National Congress, the\\n         Supreme Court of Electoral Justice and other government institutions. UNDP will accomplish these\\n         goals by providing technical assistance, policy advice, and access to better practices and knowledge\\n         networks. UNDP will support the implementation and monitoring of results -focused institutional\\n         improvement plans to ensure accountability. It will promote dialogue and consensus-building\\n         capacities in an effort to encourage effective citizen participation, focusing on women’s political\\n         participation and the prior, informed consent of indigenous communities, in order to facilitate the\\n         design and implementation of public policies. Main partners will include public institutions, civil\\n         society organizations (CSOs), international donors, the private sector and departmental and municipal\\n         governments. UNDP will also work with OHCHR, UN-Women, ILO, UNFPA, UNICEF and the\\n         United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC).\\n         12. The country has reduced its natural disaster and climate change risks. UNDP will support the\\n         participatory design and adoption of risk evaluation and mapping systems at the national level, in\\n         addition to assessing the social and economic losses caused by natural disasters. UNDP will continue\\n         to provide technical assistance and facilitate the exchange of knowledge, technologies and resources\\n         for the implementation of the recently approved national risk management policy, and strengthening\\n         the leadership of the National Emergency Secretariat. Furthermore, UNDP will support the\\n         subnational promotion and implementation of gend er-sensitive institutional and policy frameworks for\\n         local risk reduction and management, and strategies to foster community resilience. Among these\\n         strategies, the organization will foster participatory planning in basic sanitation, helping to reduce the\\n         gap in MDG 7. It will pay particular attention to ensuring indigenous communities´ access to\\n         sanitation services. UNDP will support the development of disaster prevention and response systems\\n         by providing technical assistance for the creation of risk maps, early warning systems and\\n         contingency plans at national, subnational and local levels. In addition to the National Emergency\\n         Secretariat, governors’ offices and municipalities are active partners in this process, along with other\\n         public agencies such as the Technical Planning Secretariat and the Paraguayan Indigenous Institute,\\n         humanitarian partners such as the Red Cross, Intermon/Oxfam, International Plan, and United Nations\\n         organizations that are part of the United Nations Emergency Team (UNETE), which promotes South-\\n         South cooperation and sharing of best practices with other countries in the region as part of its\\n         capacity strengthening strategy.\\n         13. UNDP has designed the country programme in close consultation with national authorities to\\n         ensure national ownership and sustainability of results. The organization will seek to build alliances\\n         with the international financial institutions in an effort to enhance the programme’s effectiveness and\\n         efficiency during implementation. It will also engage with civil society, academia and the private\\n         sector in order to advocate for and promote sustainable human development.\\n14-57594                                                                                                        5/15\\n\\n\\nDP/DCP/PRY/2\\n      III. Programme management and risks\\n           14. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Technical Planning Secretariat will coordinate the\\n           implementation of the country programme mainly under the national execution modality. They may also\\n           pursue other implementation modalities led for example by United Nations organizations, NGOs or direct\\n           UNDP implementation to enable effective responses under specific circumstances.\\n           15. UNDP will review programme effectiveness and performance with its main counterpart on an annual\\n           basis and in coordination with the UNDAF annual review process. Project boards will continue to provide the\\n           platform for participatory governance and decision-making that is nationally owned and led.\\n           16. Low institutional capacity and high turnover of senior government officials may affect the successful\\n           implementation of the programme, eventually hindering ownership, results achievements and accountability.\\n           To mitigate this risk, UNDP will promote inter-institutional and multi-actor participatory strategies and\\n           monitoring mechanisms to identify at an early stage potential implementation difficulties for immediate\\n           action.\\n           17. Difficulties mobilizing financial resources in the past may continue and can potentially jeopardize\\n           programme and project implementation and scaling-up. For this reason, having experienced a realignment\\n           exercise in 2012-2013, which resulted in the consolidation of a structure and teams with the necessary\\n           substantive and operational capacities to respond effectively and efficiently and to guarantee achievement of\\n           results, the country office will seek partnerships with multilateral banks and the private sector. UNDP will also\\n           pursue South-South and triangular cooperation opportunities that offer innovative approaches to cost-\\n           efficiency.\\n           18. The management will ensure full compliance with the UNDP programme operations policies and\\n           procedures that provide the basis for effective programme and risk management. To mitigate the risk at the\\n           project formulation stage and to enhance environmental and social sustainability, large projects will undergo a\\n           systematic review process to ensure environmental and social safeguards.\\n           19. The country programme document outlines UNDP contributions to national results and serves as the\\n           primary unit of accountability to the Executive Board for results alignment and resources assigned to the\\n           programme at the country level. Manager accountability at the country, regional and headquarter levels for the\\n           country programme is prescribed in the organization’s programme and operations policies and procedures and\\n           the internal controls framework.\\n     IV. Monitoring and evaluation\\n           20. An integrated monitoring, evaluation and knowledge management strategy will buttress the country\\n           programme and will contribute to strengthening the results management culture, learning and knowledge\\n           generation processes and support UNDP country office accountability.\\n           21. Developing national capacities for results-based management and information collection and use is one\\n           of the programme’s key strategies. UNDP will disaggregate data based on geography, gender, indigenous\\n           peoples, age and people with different capacities. Crucially, the country office will promote adequate data\\n           collection methods using different UNDP-led initiatives in order to strengthen the capacity of national data\\n           centres to provide sound information for timely decision-making.\\n           22. UNDP will monitor the country programme programmatically and operationally in coordination with\\n           implementing partners with the objective of reviewing progress against targets established at the design phase.\\n           Together, they will address issues identified and ensure lessons learned are fed back into the entire\\n           programme.\\n6/15                                                                                                                14-57594\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                      DP/DCP/PRY/2\\n         23. The organization has developed the evaluation plan for the programme based on UNDP\\n         evaluation policies. UNDP will conduct three outcome evaluations and a final country programme\\n         evaluation in 2019, measuring programme results and contributions made by UNDP to the\\n         development results under the UNDAF. These evaluations will collect evidence and identify best\\n         practices and lessons learned to improve programme implementation. UNDP will in turn consolidate\\n         this information in the form of knowledge products for possible use in South-South cooperation.\\n         24. UNDP will adjust the indicators, baselines and targets of the programme’s indicative outputs so\\n         that they are in line with the qualitative and quantitative indicators of the national development plan.\\n         25. A specialized staff member will ensure that results-based management and monitoring and\\n         evaluation principles form an integral part of the work programme to ensure evidence-based results.\\n14-57594                                                                                                       7/15\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                      DP/DCP/PRY/2\\n8/15       Annex.

The country has reduced its natural disaster and climate change risks. UNDP will support the\\n         participatory design and adoption of risk evaluation and mapping systems at the national level, in\\n         addition to assessing the social and economic losses caused by natural disasters. UNDP will continue\\n         to provide technical assistance and facilitate the exchange of knowledge, technologies and resources\\n         for the implementation of the recently approved national risk management policy, and strengthening\\n         the leadership of the National Emergency Secretariat. Furthermore, UNDP will support the\\n         subnational promotion and implementation of gend er-sensitive institutional and policy frameworks for\\n         local risk reduction and management, and strategies to foster community resilience. Among these\\n         strategies, the organization will foster participatory planning in basic sanitation, helping to reduce the\\n         gap in MDG 7. It will pay particular attention to ensuring indigenous communities´ access to\\n         sanitation services. UNDP will support the development of disaster prevention and response systems\\n         by providing technical assistance for the creation of risk maps, early warning systems and\\n         contingency plans at national, subnational and local levels. In addition to the National Emergency\\n         Secretariat, governors’ offices and municipalities are active partners in this process, along with other\\n         public agencies such as the Technical Planning Secretariat and the Paraguayan Indigenous Institute,\\n         humanitarian partners such as the Red Cross, Intermon/Oxfam, International Plan, and United Nations\\n         organizations that are part of the United Nations Emergency Team (UNETE), which promotes South-\\n         South cooperation and sharing of best practices with other countries in the region as part of its\\n         capacity strengthening strategy.\\n         13. UNDP has designed the country programme in close consultation with national authorities to\\n         ensure national ownership and sustainability of results. The organization will seek to build alliances\\n         with the international financial institutions in an effort to enhance the programme’s effectiveness and\\n         efficiency during implementation. It will also engage with civil society, academia and the private\\n         sector in order to advocate for and promote sustainable human development.\\n14-57594                                                                                                        5/15\\nDP/DCP/PRY/2\\n      III.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Technical Planning Secretariat will coordinate the\\n           implementation of the country programme mainly under the national execution modality. They may also\\n           pursue other implementation modalities led for example by United Nations organizations, NGOs or direct\\n           UNDP implementation to enable effective responses under specific circumstances.\\n           15. UNDP will review programme effectiveness and performance with its main counterpart on an annual\\n           basis and in coordination with the UNDAF annual review process. Project boards will continue to provide the\\n           platform for participatory governance and decision-making that is nationally owned and led.\\n           16. Low institutional capacity and high turnover of senior government officials may affect the successful\\n           implementation of the programme, eventually hindering ownership, results achievements and accountability.\\n           To mitigate this risk, UNDP will promote inter-institutional and multi-actor participatory strategies and\\n           monitoring mechanisms to identify at an early stage potential implementation difficulties for immediate\\n           action.\\n           17. Difficulties mobilizing financial resources in the past may continue and can potentially jeopardize\\n           programme and project implementation and scaling-up. For this reason, having experienced a realignment\\n           exercise in 2012-2013, which resulted in the consolidation of a structure and teams with the necessary\\n           substantive and operational capacities to respond effectively and efficiently and to guarantee achievement of\\n           results, the country office will seek partnerships with multilateral banks and the private sector. UNDP will also\\n           pursue South-South and triangular cooperation opportunities that offer innovative approaches to cost-\\n           efficiency.\\n           18.

Similar activities will be undertaken to promote peace\\n         between internally displaced persons and host communities.\\n   III. Programme and risk management\\n         24. This country programme document outlines UNDP contributions to national results and serves as\\n         the primary basis of accountability to the Executive Board for results alignment and resources\\n         assigned to the programme at the country level. Accountabilities of managers at the country, regional\\n         and headquarters levels with respect to country programmes are prescribed in the UNDP programme\\n         and operations policies and procedures and the internal controls framework.\\n         25. UNDP recognises the uncertainty and risks posed by the conflict in the country for the successful\\n         implementation of the proposed programme. There is a possibility of a major escalation of conflict,\\n         increased militarization, de-prioritization of key reforms or their co-option by vested interests, partisan\\n         gridlock, and continuing shortfalls in partner capacity. In the latter case, the main risks are a slow\\n         speed of response, high staff turnover, and restrictions imposed by the security environment.\\n         26. To help mitigate these risks, UNDP will engage with government and national partners to\\n         maximize national ownership, broaden the base of national implementation and apply a rigorous\\n         vetting processes to verify the capacity of partners, taking remedial action where needed. National\\n         staff will be trained to assume greater responsibilities in anticipation of any sudden evacuation of\\n         internationals. UNDP will introduce greater flexibility and responsiveness in its programming through\\n         area-based assessments and monitoring exercises aimed at early detection of challenges, and will\\n         apply fast-track procedures whenever necessary. These measures will be complemented by a further\\n         expansion of the UNDP country presence. Erbil is now a thriving programmatic and operational hub,\\n         and operations have been extended to Basra, which will serve southern governorates, and Karbala, for\\n         the mid-Euphrates governorates. During this country programme period, further expansion is\\n         envisioned in Kirkuk, as security permits. Security risks and the UNDP presence will be managed\\n         through regular programme criticality exercises so as to establish appropriate institutional\\n         arrangements. These will be reinforced by updated business continuity plans; more collective\\n         approaches (with UNAMI and the United Nations country team) for managing risk; and more realistic\\n         mutual expectations between the Government, UNAMI, UNDP, other national partners, and donors.\\n         Risk transfer through the utilization of recruitment companies will ensure that needed international\\n         experts are deployed in high-risk areas.\\n         27.

New\\n         settlers are concentrated in risk areas around large urban centres, increasing their vulnerability. Paraguay is\\n         mainly an urban country, with 59.2 per cent of its people living in cities versus 40.8 per cent in rural areas.\\n         Institutional frameworks designed to support the implementation of public policies and enable greater\\n         resilience have shown major progress at the national level. The national risk management and reduction policy\\n         approved in 2014 is a relevant step in this direction. Still, some challenges remain in consolidating an\\n         integrated national risk management and resilience promotion system and in building the country's capacity to\\n         assess and quantify the impact of disasters and other threats. While Paraguay has made efforts and progress at\\n         the national level, regulatory frameworks and institutions for the implementation of risk management policies\\n         at the local level are just emerging and need to incorporate a gender and indigenous people-sensitive\\n         approach. Likewise, the country lacks unified tools and consolidated maps at the national and subnational\\n         levels that would help to assess risks properly and foster systems to calculate economic losses resulting from\\n         disasters. With regard to disaster preparedness and response, the Government faces the challenge of\\n         developing a national early warning system and nationwide plans to address threats in a coordinated manner.\\n         6. The assessment of development results 2010 highlighted the UNDP contribution in the context of the\\n         democratic transition of the last 10 years. The assessment showed that UNDP worked in crucial areas to lay\\n         the foundations for human development; enriched the debate and thinking through its technical assistance and\\n         advisory services in a critical period of changes; and strengthened the capacities of the Executive Branch.\\n         Evaluations from 2010 and 2012 showed that UNDP had positively impacted policymaking, resulting in the\\n         first ever structured body of social policies, the creation of environmental policies, risk management policies\\n         with local accountability, and the positioning in the public agenda of the eradication of discriminatory\\n         practices based on gender and ethnicity. UNDP also contributed to developing democratic social\\n         organizations, acted as a mediator helping parties to reach agreements based on the equilibrium between\\n         social demand and the capacity of the state to meet them, and facilitated consensus building. UNDP supported\\n         the modernization and increased efficiency of public entities, which deeply impacted the creation of the Social\\n14-57594                                                                                                                3/15\\nDP/DCP/PRY/2\\n          Cabinet and its technical secretariat and the development of capacities in different ministries and national\\n          institutions.\\n          7. Lessons learned from the previous cooperation cycles suggest that the value added of UNDP in Paraguay\\n          consists in its helping to develop capacity through high quality technical assistance and advisory services that\\n          support public policy design and implementation and the application of results-based management systems.\\n          The comparative advantage of UNDP in this field is based on its own experiences, its best practices in\\n          verifiable, replicable and scalable interventions at the local or national levels, and a broad regional and global\\n          knowledge network. Key development partners have consistently drawn attention to the capacity of UNDP to\\n          facilitate the coordination of public, private and international cooperation and to foster dialogue and build\\n          consensus in the support of public policies as one of its comparative advantages. The new programme is hence\\n          consistent with the organization’s strategic institutional change and focuses on providing high-quality policy\\n          advice and programming approaches aimed at responding to development challenges.\\n          8. In order to guarantee the sustainability of UNDP interventions, the assessment of development results\\n          recommended more direct support to civil society, stronger links with parliament and the judiciary, and greater\\n          focus on the most vulnerable populations.
